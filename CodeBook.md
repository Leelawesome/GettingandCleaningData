##Description
This document provides information about the variables of the data used for the course project on the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

##Source of the Data

##Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

##Variables
The set of variables used are:

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation
* mad(): Median absolute deviation
* max(): Largest value in array
* min(): Smallest value in array
* sma(): Signal magnitude area
* energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
* iqr(): Interquartile range
* entropy(): Signal entropy
* arCoeff(): Autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
* correlation(): Correlation coefficient between two signals
* maxInds(): Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
* meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
* skewness(): Skewness of the frequency domain signal
* kurtosis(): Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
* bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
* angle(): Angle between some vectors.
