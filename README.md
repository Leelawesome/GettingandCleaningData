This is a submission to peer review for the project of the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" of the Data Analysis Specialization offered by the Johns Hopkins University.

##Project Overwiew
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with and clean a data set.

###Project Instructions:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##File Overwiew
* run_analysis.R contains the code required to perform the sequence described on the project instructions -5 steps above.
* CodeBook.md describes the variables used and has additional information about the source of the original data
* tidy_data.txt is the output of the code.
